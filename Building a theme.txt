Building a theme 

1. Make sure that there is an active venv with these libraries installed: 

    copier
    jinja2-time
    jupyterlab
    twine
    build

2. In the build directory, run 

    copier copy --trust https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-template .


3. Run 
    python -m build 


4. To post to testpypi run: 

    python -m twine upload -r testpypi dist/*


5. For other build options, also install: 
    
    hatchling 
    hatch-nodejs-version>=0.3.2
    hatch-jupyter-builder>=0.5

Then run 
    python -m build -w -v -n 

-w = wheel 
-v = verbose 
-n = not isolated (so the build is done locally, not in a tmp file)
